This calculator GUI, built using Python's Tkinter library, reflects a minimalist and efficient design. It features a compact layout sized at 300x400 pixels, centered on the screen, with a smooth, borderless interface to maintain a modern aesthetic. The application uses a translucent design (90% opacity) and a striking blue theme complemented by white text for high visibility, enhancing user experience. The interface includes a text entry field for input, styled with a large, readable font, and various buttons for numerical inputs, basic arithmetic operations, and special functions like backspace, clear, and exit. Buttons are systematically arranged in a grid layout, ensuring ergonomic accessibility, with each key press tied to specific commands, such as evaluation of expressions via Python's eval or clearing the input field. A standout feature is the inclusion of a red "C" button for clearing entries, adding functional and visual distinction. The application adapts seamlessly to resizing, thanks to dynamic row and column weight configurations. Thoughtful usability enhancements, like backspace functionality and smooth shutdown through an exit button, add polish, while the choice to remove borders ensures the calculator blends elegantly into any desktop environment.
